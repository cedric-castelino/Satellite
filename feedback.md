### Domain Modelling 15%

Good job! Some feedback: Storing device types as strings goes against OOP and should have been done with inheritance. You should show the 'has-a' relationship between sattelite/device and file with a diamond since you are storing a list of files. Having a parent class for device and sattelite (called 'entity' for example) would have been ideal since they have some similarities. 

### Coupling & Cohesion 20%

Having an entity class would simplify your controller as you have a lot of code in common for satellite and device. Good job!

## Code Quality 5%

## Blogging 5%
